# Overview

A [Reagent][Reagent] example that demonstrates the following concepts:

* Data binding.
* Component Interaction.
* Components as vars.
* Dynamically created components.
* Light-weight Eventing for code organization.
* [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) channels.

[View](http://pointslope.github.io/reagent-svg-demo/) the demo!

## TODO

* All interactions should be locked while playing back history.
* Add state serialization

## Running

Install [boot-clj](http://boot-clj.com/).

From the project root run `boot dev`.

In a browser, navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
